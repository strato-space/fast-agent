# AgentCard RFC Samples (MD)

Note: samples mirror README.md code blocks in order. Each block is a full markdown file. Some samples group multiple cards for brevity; in practice, each card lives in its own file (one card per file by default). Non-card snippets (CLI/config/usage) are included as plain markdown file content.

## Sample 1: Quickstart commands
```md
uv pip install fast-agent-mcp          # install fast-agent!
fast-agent go                          # start an interactive session
fast-agent go --url https://hf.co/mcp  # with a remote MCP
fast-agent go --model=generic.qwen2.5  # use ollama qwen 2.5
fast-agent setup                       # create an example agent and config files
uv run agent.py                        # run your first agent
uv run agent.py --model=o3-mini.low    # specify a model
uv run agent.py --transport http --port 8001  # expose as MCP server (server mode implied)
fast-agent quickstart workflow  # create "building effective agents" examples
```
