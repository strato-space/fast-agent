MCP Server for URL Elicitation Demo

This server demonstrates URL mode elicitation, which allows servers to direct
users to external URLs for sensitive interactions that should not pass through
the MCP client (OAuth flows, payment processing, API key entry, etc.).

URL mode elicitation is "out-of-band" - the user interaction happens in their
browser, not through the MCP protocol.
